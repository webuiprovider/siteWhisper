## HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE (HTML).

Since as we said, the computer understands things differently, there is a need for different ways to interpret things.

HTML... interesting, what it could be.

Plain text is something that is just text, without any styles. Numbers and words as they are.

But, we need to make stuff more beautiful, understandable and visually attractive!

```html
<h1> This is a heading </h1>
<h2> This is heading as well </h2>
<ol> This is not heading, this is Organised list
	<li> That consist of numbered items in it</li>
</ol>
```

How does browser interpret it?
