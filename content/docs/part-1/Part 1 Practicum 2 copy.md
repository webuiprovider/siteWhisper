## Using Operators in Google Search 2

### Search for Groups in Facebook that are relevant for your business.

Use operators `site:` and `intitle:`

My query looks like:

`site:https://www.facebook.com/groups/ intitle:localization OR intitle:localisation -game*`

Linkedin does not have public groups to search for in google, but you can go with your business interest there.

### Search for Public Google Sheets

`site:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/ intitle:Report`

### Search for Public Google Slides

`site:https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/ intitle:History`

### Search for Public Google Docs

`site:https://docs.google.com/document/ intitle:Roman Empire`

### Search for Public Google Forms

`site:https://docs.google.com/forms/ intitle:Feedback`

### Search for Public Github Repositories

`site:github.com intitle:scaper`

### Search for Public Google Forms

Knowing Google Search operators can make you a **hacker**. [Google Dorks](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database "Google Dorks") can be found here.
