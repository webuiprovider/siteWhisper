## Using Operators in Google Search

Maybe everyone has heard of Google Search Operators, but mostly digital marketers use that.

Let's learn most essential operators:

| Operator | Use |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| intitle:    | **[intitle:"tesla vs edison"](https://www.google.com/search?q=intitle:"tesla+vs+edison")** Search only in the page's title for a word or phrase. Use exact-match (quotes) for phrases. |
| allintitle: | **[allintitle: tesla vs edison](https://www.google.com/search?q=allintitle:+tesla+vs+edison)** Search the page title for every individual term following "allintitle:". Same as multiple intitle:'s. |
| inurl:      | **[tesla announcements inurl:2016](https://www.google.com/search?q=tesla+announcements+inurl:2016)** Look for a word or phrase (in quotes) in the document URL. Can combine with other terms. |
| allinurl:   | **[allinurl: amazon field-keywords nikon](https://www.google.com/search?q=allinurl:+amazon+field-keywords+nikon)** Search the URL for every individual term following "allinurl:". Same as multiple inurl:'s. |
| intext:     | **[intext:"orbi vs eero vs google wifi"](https://www.google.com/search?q=intext:"orbi+vs+eero+vs+google+wifi")** Search for a word or phrase (in quotes), but only in the body/document text. |
| allintext:  | **[allintext: orbi eero google wifi](https://www.google.com/search?q=allintext:+orbi+eero+google+wifi)** Search the body text for every individual term following "allintext:". Same as multiple intexts:'s. |
| filetype:   | **["tesla announcements" filetype:pdf](https://www.google.com/search?q="tesla+announcements"+filetype:pdf)** Match only a specific file type. Some examples include PDF, DOC, XLS, PPT, and TXT. |
| inanchor: | **[inanchor:"tesla announcements"](https://www.google.com/search?q=inanchor:)** Find pages linked to with the specified anchor text/phrase. Data is heavily sampled. |
