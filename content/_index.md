Free beginner tech courses for entrepreneurs, marketers and managers for implementing automated and scaling solutions.

>**Personal letter from the author**:
I have spent *years* to figure out how does the technology works. 
Being a non-technical founder I struggled a lot with understanding basics conceptions of web, technology and development for the sake of solving problems efficiently, not manually. I want to share my knowledge on how to you to automate  processes, build technical teams with as low cost as possible or even free. Sign up for my course and I will transform the way how you work. You will train yourself to **solve real business problems** and will get all tools to implement them efficiently.
